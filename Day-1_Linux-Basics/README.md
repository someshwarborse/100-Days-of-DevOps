# Day 1: Linux Basics - Commands

## ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered
- Basic Linux Commands: `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `chmod`, etc.
- Navigating the File System
- Working with Files and Directories
- Understanding File Permissions

## ðŸ”¥ Hands-on Practice
- Practiced file and directory operations
- Created, modified, and deleted files
- Experimented with file permissions

## ðŸš€ Challenges Faced
- "Permission denied" when trying to access system files â†’ âœ… Used sudo for administrative tasks.
- "Command not found" for some tools â†’ âœ… Installed missing packages using apt-get install.
- Accidentally deleted an important file ðŸ˜… â†’ âœ… Learned about rm -i for safe deletions.

## ðŸ”¥ Cool Linux Tricks I Found:
ðŸš€ Using !! to repeat the last command without retyping it.
ðŸš€ Creating command shortcuts with alias, e.g., alias ll='ls -la'.
