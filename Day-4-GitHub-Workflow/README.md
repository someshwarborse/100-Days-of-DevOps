# 📅 Day 4: GitHub & Git Workflow – Pull Requests, Conflicts & Collaboration 🚀  

## 📌 Topics Covered  
- Understanding **GitHub Workflow** – Forks, Cloning, Pull Requests (PRs)  
- Managing **Code Collaboration** with PRs & Code Reviews  
- Resolving **Merge Conflicts** and Best Practices  
- Using **GitHub Issues** for tracking  

## 🔥 Hands-on Practice  
✅ Forked & cloned repositories using `git clone`  
✅ Created and pushed branches using `git checkout -b feature-branch` and `git push`  
✅ Opened a **Pull Request** (PR) and merged it  
✅ Simulated and resolved **merge conflicts** using `git merge` & `git rebase`  
✅ Explored **GitHub Issues** for project management  

## 🚀 Challenges Faced & Solutions  
- **Merge Conflict in PR** → ✅ Used `git merge --abort`, manually resolved the conflict, and committed changes.  
- **Accidentally pushed to the wrong branch** → ✅ Used `git reset --soft HEAD~1` to undo the commit before pushing.  
- **Forgot to update local branch** → ✅ Used `git pull origin main --rebase` before working.  

## 🔥 Cool GitHub Tricks I Found  
🚀 **Squashing Commits** – Used `git rebase -i HEAD~3` to keep commit history clean.  
🚀 **Draft PRs** – Opened a draft pull request for feedback before finalizing changes.
